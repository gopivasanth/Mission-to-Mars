# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project
Robin wanted to create a web app that scraped multiple websites and extracted information on the Mission to Mars. 
We extracted the most recent news, featured image and some facts about mars. Robin realized that she wanted to add the hemispheres of mars to the web app as well!

### Purpose and Analysis

The purpose of this work was to extract the desired data form different website and include it to our web app.

We can run the web app using Flask and the file below:

[app.py](https://github.com/gopivasanth/Mission-to-Mars/blob/359e5e62435cea0e59d9c941ee39212d6fc12b43/app.py)

The HTML template for this web app can be found in the file below:
